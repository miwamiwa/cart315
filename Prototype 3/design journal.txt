cop escaping game 
In this game prototype you drive a car through a city, picking up coins as you go. There are traffic lights and text feedback telling you if you crossed a green, yellow or red light. Cops (white capsules) appear at random locations and have a chance of catching you crossing red lights. The idea is that this could lead to some game where you escape the cops' gaze and collect as many goodies as possible - maybe there could even be car chases.
