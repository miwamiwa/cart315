tilting dog
group prototype II
melissa and samuel

In this game you travel on a giant doggo's back, collecting stray pieces of peperoni and avoiding balls of water that fall across the surface. Everyone once in a while, the doggo switches positions, making objects fall the other way. The player gains points from gathering the peperoni and loses them when he is hit by a ball. He can try to use the peperoni to block off balls, or try to keep the field clear. 
When the dog switches positions, the camera moves out in order to see the dog moving (there would be an animation there...), otherwise the camera is always below the player and locked facing upwards, in order to emphasize the length of the walking area. 

Design questions to be answered by the playtest
Does the placement of the camera make sense for the player? Is it a bother not seeing behind them. 
Do the players develop any tactics around the placement of peperoni pieces?
Does the pressure of losing points make the game feel challenging?
Is the doggo's switch of position too sudden? does it feel like the player has to be warned in some way?

Questions for the playtesters
- how do you like way the camera is facing? do you feel like you are missing gameplay behind you?
- how did you feel about your points? did you keep track?
- did you feel challenged by the premise of losing points? If not, what do you think prevented that?
- did you feel like you could use the peperoni pieces to leverage the water balls?
- how do you feel about the switch of positions? did it come too suddenly? camera motion too much?
