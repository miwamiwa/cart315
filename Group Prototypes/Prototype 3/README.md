It's panic mode at the dog factory! Dog food, balls and dogs are all being sent to the same room and the struggle is real. Dogs are attracted by balls of their own color, but they are also even more attracted by the dog food. Try to lead the dogs back to their respective boxes by kicking the balls towards them.
Press WASD to move, Space to jump, P to powermove/kick.
Push the buttons on the platform above to spawn more dogs and balls.

Design questions to be answered by the playtest: 

In this prototype there are a few mechanics that happen independently of the player's inputs. The player can has find ways to affect the mechanics at play so they can work to his advantage. 
- How do players react to the interaction with the dogs? Do they feel like they have control? Does it seem overbearing?
- What does the player prefer doing out of the options he finds? Does that work with or against the game's intention?
- The buttons aren't well founded in a system for now, but is the user still tempted to interact with them?

Questions for playtesters:

Was there a strategy to your gathering?
Is it entertaining to observe the dogs' behaviour?
Did you give up on the goals of gathering the dogs and just spam the buttons?
Was there not enough or too much dog food?
Is it too difficult to gather the dogs using the balls? (The kicking not being easy/responsive enough)
How do you like the color associations, does it help you grasp what is going on?
Did you try pressing multiple buttons to fill up the room, or did you just press the button once and try to bring the dogs back immediately?
At what point does the screen seem too full of dogs and balls visually?

Feedback
All three testers mentionned enjoying the buttons, for different reasons. Maybe something could be introduced to incentivise their use. 
Most users couldn't entirely decipher what they had to do because of faulty mechanics. One tester mentionned feeling like he had to read our notes to understand the setting, which is understandable. A short introduction/instruction page in the beginning might help.
Direct interaction with the dogs seemed problematic, though their being an active agent in the game seemed to interest most users.
